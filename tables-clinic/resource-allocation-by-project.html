            <h2>User story</h2>

            <p>"As someone interested in legislative reform, I want to know how many people are working on each consolidation project, so that I can understand how legislative resources are allocated in Wales."</p>

            <p>Roles are listed in a consistent way for each project</p>

            <h2>Numbers of legislative personnel working on consolidation projects since October 2021</h2>

            <h3>Historic Environment (Wales) Bill</h3>

            <p>5 legislative personnel worked on this project, including:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>1 Assistant Legislative Counsel</li>
                <li>1 Legislative Counsel</li>
                <li>1 Senior Legislative Counsel</li>
                <li>2 Senior Legislative Translators</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The Assistant Legislative Counsel allocated to this project worked on one aspect of the Bill alongside other projects. The Senior Legislative Counsel was promoted to this grade (from Legislative Counsel) during this project and joined the project part way through.</p>

            <p>Legislative equivalence has been undertaken by several members of the Office of the Legislative Counsel on all of these projects. It is not possible to quantify the numbers, grades, or percentage of time taken to do this.</p>

            <p>One Senior Legislative Translator produced the initial translation and another edited it. Both also contributed to the legislative equivalence process. Several other members of the Legislative Translation Unit were brought in at key points during the project.</p>


            <h3>Legislation (Repeals) (Wales) Bill</h3>

            <p>6 legislative personnel worked on this project, including:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>3 Assistant Legislative Counsel</li>
                <li>1 Senior Legislative Counsel</li>
                <li>2 Senior Legislative Translators</li>
            </ul>

            <p>'Legislation (Repeals) (Wales) Bill' is an indicative short-title used to refer to a Bill that will repeal obsolete and spent provisions in relation to Wales.</p>
            
            <p>All 4 legislative drafters worked on this project during downtime on their other projects. Work on this project continues and drafting resources may change in the future.</p>

            <h3>Planning (Wales) Bill</h3>

            <p>6 legislative personnel worked on this project, including:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>2 Assistant Legislative Counsel</li>
                <li>1 Legislative Counsel</li>
                <li>1 Senior Legislative Counsel</li>
                <li>2 Senior Legislative Translators</li>
            </ul>

            <p>'Planning (Wales) Bill' is an indicative short-title used to refer to the consolidation of planning law in Wales.</p>

            <p>Some Legislative Counsel who worked on this project also worked on the Historic Environment Bill during overlapping time periods. Their work on this project took place during gaps in other projects. Work on this project continues and drafting resources may change in the future.</p>
