            <ol class="lower-alpha">
                <li>The ALC allocated to this project worked on one aspect of the Bill alongside other projects; the SLC was promoted to this grade (from LC) during this project, and joined the project part of the way through (see also note c).</li>
                <li>All 4 legislative drafters have worked on this project in occasional periods of quieter time on their other projects, rather than all working on this for a dedicated period of time. Work on this project continues and the drafting resource may change in the future.</li>
                <li>Work on the planning project has been undertaken by some of the same legislative Counsel who worked on the Historic Environment project, and during overlapping time periods. Work on the planning project continues and the drafting resource may change in the future. The work of the LC on this project has taken place during gaps in other projects.</li>
                <li>Legislative equivalence has been undertaken by several members of the Office of the Legislative Counsel on all 3 Bills, it is not possible to quantify the numbers or grades (or percentage of time) taken to do this.</li>
                <li>One senior legislative translator to produce the initial translation and one to edit. Both also contributed to the legislative equivalence process. In addition to this, several other members of the Legislative Translation Unit were brought in at key points of the project.</li>
                <li>One senior legislative translator to produce the initial translation and one to edit. Both will also contribute to the legislative equivalence process. Work on this project continues and the translation resource may change in the future.</li>
                <li>"Legislation (Repeals) (Wales) Bill" is an indicative short-title being used to refer to a Bill that will repeal obsolete and spent provisions in relation to Wales.</li>
                <li>"Planning (Wales) Bill" is an indicative short-title being used to refer to the consolidation of planning law in Wales.</li>
